    <h3 class="text-block_title">Overview</h3>
    <p class="text-block_role">Role: Discovery, UI Design, Web Design, HTML/CSS</p>
    <p class="text-block_copy">Many times, there is a difference between the way that has worked and the way that works best. <a href="http://vendorsenders.com/" target="_blank">VendorSenders</a> was one such case, as the client had been managing vendor engagements for a large group of companies using nothing more than an off the shelf digital calendar. It had gotten them a sizable customer base, but they were unable to grow in the face of an exponentially increasing time burden. They needed to reduce the complexity of scheduling vendors while at the same time increasing the specificity of their tool. With my freelance partner, we delivered a wordpress landing page and full-scale web application for them.</p>

<section class="text-block">
  <h3 class="text-block_title">Challenge</h3>
  <p class="text-block_copy">I worked with the client to understand their specific needs so I could design a scheduling application tailored to their needs. My client was a vendor herself so I was able to do some user research and discover pain points of the current vendor scheduling process, which was essentially cold-calling companies. </p>

    <p>By identifying the vendor's painpoints, I was able to design a new product that became the foundation for our client's business.</p>

<section class="text-block">
  <h3 class="text-block_title">Solution</h3>
  <p class="text-block_copy">I started our with a few rough sketches to create a paper wireframe of the layout of the calendar and figure out needs for the settings sidebar. The next steps involved bringing the wireframe to life by desiging UI elements in Photoshop based on their branding. I focused on creating a simple interface for the vendors and a more complex admin experience to help my client facilitate their business. Finally I worked with a programmer to build the application from scratch. I implemented the CSS as needed.</p>

  <p class="text-block_copy">We worked through several iterations to create the perfect experience for both the admins and the vendors. Vendors are now able to book their own appointments from a selection of available times set by a host company. Frequency of bookings and types of vendor are also monitored and can be specified by the host company. Allowing customers access to this application saved our client time, while giving the customers themselves a platform to connect. The application is currently in a by-invitation only beta.</p>

<section class="feature-block">
  <div class="feature-block_copy">
    <h3 class="feature-block_title">Customize the experience</h3>
    <p>I designed the experience for two separate personas - Vendors and hosting Companies. This allowed a customized experience for different users of the application.</p>

    <p>I designed the search with scale in mind. When there would be hundreds of companies to search for, it had to be quick for the user to find the one they had in mind.</p>
